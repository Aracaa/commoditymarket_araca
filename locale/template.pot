"A gold ingot is far too valuable to use as a basic unit of value, so it has "
"become common practice to divide the standard gold bar into one thousand "

"Gold coins can be deposited and withdrawn from markets that accept them as "

"The largest and most accessible market for the common man, the King's Market "
"uses gold coins as its medium of exchange (or the equivalent in gold ingots "
"- 1000 coins to the ingot). However, as a respectable institution of the "
"surface world, the King's Market operates only during the hours of daylight. "
"The purchase and sale of swords and explosives is prohibited in the King's "
"Market. Gold coins are represented by a '☼' symbol."

"Unlike most markets that have well-known fixed locations that travelers "
"congregate to, the network of Trader's Caravans is fluid and dynamic in "
"their locations. A Trader's Caravan can show up anywhere, make modest "
"trades, and then be gone the next time you visit them. These caravans accept "
"gold and gold coins as a currency (one gold ingot to one thousand gold coins "
"exchange rate). Any reasonably-wealthy person can create a signpost marking "
"a location where Trader's Caravans will make a stop."

"One does not usually associate Goblins with the sort of sophistication that "
"running a market requires. Usually one just associates Goblins with savagery "
"and violence. But they understand the principle of tit-for-tat exchange, and "
"if approached correctly they actually respect the concepts of ownership and "
"debt. However, for some peculiar reason they understand this concept in the "
"context of coal lumps. Goblins deal in the standard coal lump as their form "
"of currency, conceptually divided into 100 coal centilumps (though Goblin "
"brokers prefer to \"keep the change\" when giving back actual coal lumps)."

"Deep in the bowels of the world, below even the goblin-infested warrens and "
"ancient delvings of the dwarves, dark and mysterious beings once dwelled. A "
"few still linger to this day, and facilitate barter for those brave souls "
"willing to travel in their lost realms. The Undermarket uses Mese chips "
"('₥') as a currency - twenty chips to the Mese fragment. Though traders are "
"loathe to physically break Mese crystals up into units that small, as it "
"renders it useless for other purposes."
