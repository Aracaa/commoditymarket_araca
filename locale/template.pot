"The largest and most accessible market for the common man, the King's Market "

"- @1 coins to the ingot). However, as a respectable institution of the "

"Unlike most markets that have well-known fixed locations that travelers "

"their locations. A Trader's Caravan can show up anywhere, make modest "
"trades, and then be gone the next time you visit them. These caravans accept "
"gold and gold coins as a currency (one gold ingot to @1 gold coins exchange "
"rate). Any reasonably-wealthy person can create a signpost marking a "
"location where Trader's Caravans will make a stop."

"One does not usually associate Goblins with the sort of sophistication that "
"running a market requires. Usually one just associates Goblins with savagery "
"and violence. But they understand the principle of tit-for-tat exchange, and "
"if approached correctly they actually respect the concepts of ownership and "
"debt. However, for some peculiar reason they understand this concept in the "
"context of coal lumps. Goblins deal in the standard coal lump as their form "
"of currency, conceptually divided into 100 coal centilumps (though Goblin "
"brokers prefer to \"keep the change\" when giving back actual coal lumps)."

"Deep in the bowels of the world, below even the goblin-infested warrens and "
"ancient delvings of the dwarves, dark and mysterious beings once dwelled. A "
"few still linger to this day, and facilitate barter for those brave souls "
"willing to travel in their lost realms. The Undermarket uses Mese chips "
"('₥') as a currency - twenty chips to the Mese fragment. Though traders are "
"loathe to physically break Mese crystals up into units that small, as it "
"renders it useless for other purposes."
